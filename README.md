# Machine-Learning-Project

- I have build a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and engine size.
- The project involved collecting and cleaning a dataset of used car listings from a popular online marketplace.
- The cleaned dataset was then used to train multiple regression models using scikit-learn library in Python.
- The best performing model was based on its prediction accuracy, which was measured using mean absolute error and R^2 score.
